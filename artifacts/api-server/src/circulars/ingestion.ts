/**
 * ingestion.ts — persisting a GCN Circular
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE FEATURE.
 *
 *   validate → persist the original text → associate → enqueue AI extraction
 *
 * The circular is written to the database BEFORE anything clever happens to
 * it. Every step after persistence is best-effort: association can fail and
 * leave the circular unattached, extraction can fail and leave it unenriched,
 * and in both cases the human-authored scientific source is safe. The one
 * outcome this module must make impossible is a circular that arrived and was
 * lost, and no model is on the path that could cause that.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT
 * ----------------
 * Circulars do NOT pass through `applyAlertFilter`. That filter exists to
 * reject retractions, MDC/mock notices and sub-threshold machine alerts — it
 * encodes rules about machine-generated Notices. A Circular is a human
 * scientific communication; "sub-threshold" is not a property it has, and a
 * circular announcing a retraction is itself important scientific information
 * that must be kept, not dropped.
