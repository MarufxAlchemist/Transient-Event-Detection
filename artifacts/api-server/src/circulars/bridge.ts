/**
 * bridge.ts — handling a `circular` frame from the Python GCN backend
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Python backend owns the single Kafka connection and forwards every
 * message over the existing WebSocket at PYTHON_BACKEND_URL. Notices arrive as
 * `{type:"alert"}` and are handled by lib/kafkaConsumer.ts; circulars arrive as
 * `{type:"circular"}` and are handled here.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE AND A SEPARATE PATH
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * Nothing in the notice path applies to a circular:
 *
 *   * ALLOWED_TOPICS — a per-observatory notice allow-list. `gcn.circulars`
 *     carries reports about every observatory at once.
 *   * applyAlertFilter — rejects retractions, MDC/mock notices and
 *     sub-threshold machine alerts. A circular has no threshold, and a
 *     circular announcing a retraction is itself important information that
 *     must be kept.
 *   * the core.events UPSERT — a circular is not a detection and must never
 *     create or modify an event row.
 *
 * Keeping the two paths physically apart means a future change to the notice
 * filter cannot start silently discarding human-authored science.
