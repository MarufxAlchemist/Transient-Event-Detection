test_circular_routing.py
------------------------
The Python backend's only job for GCN Circulars is to route them somewhere
completely separate from notices and forward them verbatim. These tests protect
exactly that, because the failure they prevent is silent:

  * A circular reaching the notice normalizer would be given an invented
    detection time, position and significance, and stored as a detection that
    never happened.
  * A circular whose payload key was `event` instead of `circular` would be run
    through the consumer's alert adapter for the same reason.
  * A circular in the alert replay buffer would be handed to a reconnecting
    dashboard as event history.

The Kafka broker is stubbed, so these run with no credentials and no network.
