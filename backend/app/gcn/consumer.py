    Broadcast one GCN Circular to WebSocket clients, verbatim.

    This function deliberately does almost nothing. It does NOT normalize, does
    NOT extract coordinates from the body, and does NOT decide which event the
    circular belongs to. All of that happens in the Node api-server, which owns
    the database and can therefore match the circular against core.events
    deterministically. Guessing here — with no access to the event table —
    is how a circular ends up attached to the wrong burst.

    The one exception is `regexp_hints`: deterministic, offline regex triage
    from astro-colibri-circular-parser (see circular_hints.py) — content
    labels like "likely_redshift_report" or "matched_terms", never a
    coordinate, an event match, or anything that could misattach a burst. It
    rides alongside the untouched payload, not inside it, so raw_payload on
    the Node side stays exactly what GCN published.

    the other would run a circular through the alert path and store a detection
    that never happened.

    Never raises. A malformed circular is logged and dropped at this hop; the
    Kafka loop must not stop for it. A hints failure is not a malformed
